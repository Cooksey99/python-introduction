"""
Self-Check Questions:
====================
After completing the exercises, ask yourself:

1. Can I write a basic print statement without looking at examples?
2. Do I understand the difference between printing text and numbers?
3. Can I combine text and numbers in a single print statement?
4. Do I know how to use both single and double quotes?
5. Can I create and run a Python file successfully?

If you answered "yes" to all questions, you're ready for Day 2!
If not, review the concepts and practice more before moving on.

Common Mistakes to Watch For:
============================
- Forgetting quotes around text
- Using Print instead of print (capitalization matters)
- Forgetting to save the file before running
- Missing parentheses in print()
- Unmatched quotes (opening quote without closing quote)

Remember: Making mistakes is part of learning! Read error messages 
carefully - they often tell you exactly what's wrong.
