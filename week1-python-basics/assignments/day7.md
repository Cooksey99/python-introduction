    "location": "",
    "email": "",
    "phone": "",
    "birth_year": 0,
    "occupation": "",
    "interests": []
}

contacts = {}  # {contact_id: {name, phone, email, notes}}

goals = {}  # {goal_id: {title, description, category, deadline, completed, created_date}}

expenses = []  # [{date, amount, category, description, type: 'income'/'expense'}]

## üí° Sample Implementation Snippets

### Profile Management Example
```python
def setup_profile():
    """Setup user profile with comprehensive information"""
    print("=== Personal Profile Setup ===")
    
    user_profile["name"] = input("Full name: ").strip().title()
    
    while True:
        try:
            age = int(input("Age: "))
            if 0 < age < 150:
                user_profile["age"] = age
                break
            else:
                print("Please enter a realistic age (1-149)")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number")
    
    user_profile["location"] = input("Location (City, State): ").strip().title()
    user_profile["email"] = input("Email address: ").strip().lower()
    user_profile["phone"] = input("Phone number: ").strip()
    user_profile["birth_year"] = 2024 - user_profile["age"]
    user_profile["occupation"] = input("Occupation: ").strip().title()
    
    # Get interests as a list
    interests_input = input("Interests (comma separated): ").strip()
    user_profile["interests"] = [interest.strip().title() 
                                for interest in interests_input.split(",") 
                                if interest.strip()]
    
    print(f"\nProfile created for {user_profile['name']}!")
```

### Goal Tracking Example
```python
def add_goal():
    """Add a new goal with validation"""
    import datetime
    
    title = input("Goal title: ").strip().title()
    if not title:
        print("Goal title cannot be empty!")
        return
    
    description = input("Goal description: ").strip()
    category = input("Category (health/career/learning/personal): ").strip().lower()
    
    # Get deadline
    while True:
        deadline_str = input("Deadline (YYYY-MM-DD): ").strip()
        try:
            deadline = datetime.datetime.strptime(deadline_str, "%Y-%m-%d").date()
            if deadline > datetime.date.today():
                break
            else:
                print("Deadline must be in the future!")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please use YYYY-MM-DD format")
    
    goal_id = len(goals) + 1
    goals[goal_id] = {
        "title": title,
        "description": description,
        "category": category,
        "deadline": deadline,
        "completed": False,
        "created_date": datetime.date.today(),
        "completion_date": None
    }
    
    print(f"Goal '{title}' added successfully!")
```

### Analytics Example
```python
def generate_expense_report():
    """Generate comprehensive expense analysis"""
    if not expenses:
        print("No expense data available!")
        return
    
    # Calculate totals
    total_income = sum(t["amount"] for t in expenses if t["type"] == "income")
    total_expenses = sum(t["amount"] for t in expenses if t["type"] == "expense")
    net_savings = total_income - total_expenses
    
    # Category analysis
    expense_categories = {}
    for transaction in expenses:
        if transaction["type"] == "expense":
            category = transaction["category"]
            expense_categories[category] = expense_categories.get(category, 0) + transaction["amount"]
    
    # Generate report
    print("\n=== Expense Report ===")
    print(f"Total Income: ${total_income:,.2f}")
    print(f"Total Expenses: ${total_expenses:,.2f}")
    print(f"Net Savings: ${net_savings:,.2f}")
    print(f"Savings Rate: {(net_savings/total_income)*100:.1f}%" if total_income > 0 else "N/A")
    
    print("\nExpenses by Category:")
    for category, amount in sorted(expense_categories.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
        percentage = (amount / total_expenses) * 100 if total_expenses > 0 else 0
        print(f"  {category.title()}: ${amount:,.2f} ({percentage:.1f}%)")
```
