## üìö Learning Reflection Questions

After completing your project, reflect on these questions:

1. **What was the most challenging part of this project?**
2. **Which concept from Week 1 do you feel most confident about?**
3. **What would you like to add to this project if you had more time?**
4. **How did combining different data types help solve problems?**
5. **What programming concepts do you want to learn next?**

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues:
- **Syntax Errors**: Check quotes, parentheses, and indentation
- **Name Errors**: Make sure variables are defined before use
- **Logic Errors**: Print intermediate values to debug
- **Organization**: Break complex code into smaller parts

### Debugging Strategy:
1. Read error messages carefully
2. Check line numbers mentioned in errors
3. Test small sections of code independently
4. Use print statements to see what's happening
5. Ask for help when stuck

## üéØ Extension Ideas for Future Weeks

This project can be extended as you learn more:
- **Week 2**: Add functions to organize code better
- **Week 3**: Add file saving/loading capabilities
- **Week 4**: Create a class-based version
- **Week 5**: Add a simple GUI interface
