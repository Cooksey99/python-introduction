Teaching Notes:
==============

Key Learning Points Demonstrated:
1. Basic print() syntax with text and numbers
2. String handling with single and double quotes
3. Combining multiple items in print statements
4. Using comments to document code
5. Creating formatted output for visual appeal

Common Student Solutions to Expect:
- Simple, direct answers (which are perfectly correct!)
- Creative variations in ASCII art and stories
- Different personal information in introduction exercises
- Various approaches to the business card formatting

Encourage students to:
- Experiment with different approaches
- Add their own creative touches
- Practice typing code rather than copy-pasting
- Read their solutions out loud to check for errors

Assessment Opportunities:
- Check that students understand quotes vs. no quotes for text vs. numbers
- Verify they can combine text and numbers in print statements
- Look for proper use of comments
- Observe problem-solving approach in the bonus challenge
