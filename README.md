A comprehensive, hands-on Python programming course designed for complete beginners. Learn Python through practical exercises, real-world projects, and automated testing with immediate feedback.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Install Python 3.11+** from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads)
3. **Install pytest** for testing:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install pytest
   ```
4. **Navigate to Week 1**: `cd week1-python-basics`
5. **Start learning**: Open `assignments/day1.md`

## 🎯 Learning Approach

### **Function-Based Exercises**
Every exercise is a function that students implement:
```python
def exercise_1():
    """
    Return the string "Hello, Python!"
    
    Returns:
        str: The exact string "Hello, Python!"
    """
    # Your code here:
    return "Hello, Python!"
```

### **Immediate Feedback**
Students get instant feedback without running tests:
```bash
python exercises/day1_exercises.py
# Shows: ✓ Result: 'Hello, Python!' 
#    or: ✗ Not implemented (returns None)
```

### **Automated Testing**
Comprehensive tests verify correctness:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_day1.py -v
# Shows exactly which requirements are met
```

## 🎓 For Students

### **Daily Workflow**
1. **Read assignment** (`assignments/dayX.md`) to understand concepts
2. **Complete exercises** (`exercises/dayX_exercises.py`) - implement each function
3. **Test your work** - run the exercise file directly for immediate feedback
4. **Verify correctness** - run automated tests to confirm your solutions
5. **Check solutions** (`solutions/dayX_solutions.py`) if you get stuck
6. **Build confidence** - see your progress with clear success indicators

### **What Makes This Course Different**
- ✅ **No guessing** - clear requirements for every exercise
- ✅ **Immediate feedback** - know instantly if your code works
- ✅ **Progressive learning** - each day builds on previous concepts
- ✅ **Real projects** - build actual applications, not just toy examples
- ✅ **Professional practices** - learn functions, testing, and good code structure from day 1

### **Success Indicators**
- **Beginner**: All exercises return correct values, tests pass
- **Intermediate**: Implement bonus features, optimize solutions
- **Advanced**: Extend projects with creative features
